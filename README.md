# config_utilities
Utility tools to work with C++ config structs

# TODO
- [ ] Clean readme
- [ ] Add Docs and how-to for most important features
- [ ] Unit tests

# Known Limitatons
- [ ] Minor: Variable Configs currently do not print defaults. Possible remedies: Make Variable Configs templated only on creation, or integrate getting default values into C++ struct visitation.
