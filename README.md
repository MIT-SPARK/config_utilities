# config_utilities
Utility tools to work with C++ config structs.

# TODO
- [ ] Clean readme
- [ ] Add Docs and how-to for most important features
- [ ] Unit tests

# Known Limitatons
- [ ] Minor: Variable Configs currently do not print defaults. Possible remedies: Make Variable Configs templated only on creation, or integrate getting default values into C++ struct visitation.

# Sort of nice but niche feature requests
- [ ] Refactor Config checking to get names and types.
- [ ] Make visitors sequential and some extra clean up.
- [ ] Clean up linking, install, and deps.
